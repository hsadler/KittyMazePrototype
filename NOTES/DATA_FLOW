DATA FLOW


Q:  How do you add new assets to the game (kitties and accessories) while
    also keeping datastores of what the player has unlocked and currently
    selected?

A:  Kitty and Accessory assets should be able to be imported into Unity and just
    work. This can be achieved by having a check, on game start-up, the
    GameObjects in the Resources directory and add them, with default
    start-state, to the datastores.
