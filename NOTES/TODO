- TODO NEXT:
	X write docs for kitty/accessory asset creation and import pipeline
	- add testing functionality to game:
		X see all kitties and accessories
		- immediately finish maze
	- reskin buttons:
		- go-to-maze
		- go-to-dressup
		- go-back
		- go-to-home
		- play
		- kitties-scroll-list
		- accessories-scroll-list
	- reskin main menu scene:
		- background
		- header (maybe)
	- reskin dressup scene:
		- background
		- scroll list
	- reskin maze
	- reskin mase-modal
	- modal animations
	- iterate on style (maybe)
	- add more kitties and accessories


TODO NEXT PHASE:
	- variations on maze start and end points
	- consider single accessory unlock per kitty unlock
		(so that kitties always have at least one accessory)
	- highlight selected kitty and accessories in scroll lists
	- kitty footprints in maze


- SYSTEMS:
	X maze progression
	X unlock new accessory or new kitty


- UX:
	- maze completion modal and experience


- DESIGN:
	- kitty presentation:
		- background
		- kitty
		- nav buttons
		- multiple kitties?
		- what kitty items?
	- kitty dress up:
		- background
		- kitty
		- item scroll/search
		- item placement on kitty
		- back nav
	- maze:
		- background
		- walls
		- start-point
		- end-point
		- kitty
		- kitty trail (paw prints)


- ADDITIONAL IDEAS TO CONSIDER:
	- increasing difficulty of mazes
	- multiple items to pickup in the maze
	- unlock items per X number of maze completions
	- mazes portal to different mazes for item collection and final goal
