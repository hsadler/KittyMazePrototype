- TODO NEXT:
    X POC object traversal through maze from start to finish
    X POC procedural maze creation algo


- SYSTEMS:
    X MazeSceneManager
    X start-point
    X end-point
    X scene reload
    X maze data models:
        X maze
        X cell
        X wall

        - nav buttons
        - multiple kitties?
        - what kitty items?
    - kitty dress up:

        - kitty
        - item scroll/search
        - item placement on kitty
        - back nav

- ADDITIONAL IDEAS TO CONSIDER:
    - increasing difficulty of mazes
    - multiple items to pickup in the maze
