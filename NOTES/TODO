- TODO NEXT:
    X import varied kitty accessories before starting system building
    X build KittySelect Scene (incorporated in dress-up scene instead)
    X mock kitty-select scroll list
    X mock accessory-select scroll list
    - change kitty and accessory overlays to be entirely sprite based (for UI and gameObject use)
    - mock kitty into maze scene
    - mock maze-progression modal
    - mock accessory unlock
    - tech spec data models and persistent data management
    - draft data schemas
    - implement syncing of Kitty and Accessory resources with datastores
    

- SYSTEMS:
    X MazeSceneManager
    X start-point
    X end-point
    X scene reload
    X maze data models:
        X maze
        X cell
        X wall
    X maze generation service
    X rendering of maze model
    - selected kitty
    - selected accessories per kitty
    - maze progression
    - unlock new accessory or new kitty
    - maze stats data collection


- UX:
    X MainMenu Scene 1st pass
    X DressUp Scene 1st pass
    X Maze Scene 1st pass
    - kitty accessories click-equip in dressup-scene
    - KittySelect Scene 1st pass
    - maze completion modal and experience


- DESIGN:
    - kitty presentation:
        - background
        - kitty
        - nav buttons
        - multiple kitties?
        - what kitty items?
    - kitty dress up:
        - background
        - kitty
        - item scroll/search
        - item placement on kitty
        - back nav
    - maze:
        - background
        - walls
        - start-point
        - end-point
        - kitty
        - kitty trail (paw prints)


- ADDITIONAL IDEAS TO CONSIDER:
    - increasing difficulty of mazes
    - multiple items to pickup in the maze
    - unlock items per X number of maze completions
